## About Me  
I didn’t step into data analytics with all the answers—just one question:  
**“What story is hidden in this dataset?”**  

That single thought took me from experimenting with Excel sheets to building pipelines in Azure Databricks, dashboards in Power BI, and workflow automations with AI tools.  
For me, data isn’t just numbers—it’s patterns, stories, and the power to change decisions.

## Professional Snapshot  
- Currently at **Krishnav Tech**: Working with SQL Server, PySpark, and Azure Databricks, turning raw data into insights that drive business moves.  
- Past at **ELEVATE LABS**: Explored real-time data visualization, where I learned that a sharp dashboard can say more than a hundred-page report.  
- Hands-on Experience: Job simulations with **Deloitte** and **Goldman Sachs**, plus certifications from HackerRank and Kaggle.

## Technical Toolkit  
- Languages & Libraries: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), SQL  
- Visualization & BI: Power BI, Tableau, Advanced Excel  
- Data Engineering: Databricks, PySpark, Azure Data Factory, Dimensional Modeling (Star/Snowflake), SCD types, ERDs  
- Automation: n8n, Make (workflow automation)  
- Strength: Simplifying messy datasets into clear insights and dashboards that people can actually use.

## What Drives Me  
The real win for me isn’t just writing queries or models—it’s the moment when someone sees their data in a completely new light.  
That’s when I know the work mattered.
